"""
Activate and instantiate the package environment, silently.

    julia -i activate.jl

Run this way it leaves a REPL with the environment active and its manifest
instantiated; from an existing REPL, `include` it for the same effect. The
first instantiation of an environment resolves and precompiles and is
therefore slow; afterwards it is a no-op.

Every entry point of this environment includes this file as its first
statement, so running a script directly needs no preparation.
